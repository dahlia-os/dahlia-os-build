# DahliaOS Build (BETA)

Builds the Dahlia operating system.

#### source.sh currently is broken so please refrain from using until a propper build system for Dahlia is built. If you would like to build Fuchisa, please use the scripts found in the FuchsiaOS-Build folder.


## To Build

1. Setup.sh - downloads required linux packages.

2. Source.sh - downloads fuchsia/dahlia scource.

3. Build.sh - builds fuchsia/dahlia for use.
(Note: at this time only Ermine is supported, pangolin support comming soon!)
